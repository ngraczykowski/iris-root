## Conventional commits

[The Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer(s)]

The ADR introducing conventional commits to Iris [can be found here](docs/adr/0001-using_conventional_commits.md).

**Please use conventional commits when contributing to Iris!**

## Pre-commit

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.

**Please install and use pre-commit for all contributions to Iris!**
