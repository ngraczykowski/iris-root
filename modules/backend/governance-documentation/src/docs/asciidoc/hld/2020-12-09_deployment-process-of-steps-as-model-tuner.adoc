= HLD #25

- Reference ticket: TBA
- Reason: We want to present the process of preparing, approving and deployment of steps configuration on a pre-prod and prod environment.

ALT on the diagram below presents alternatives:

* import in PROD can be done using CLI (command line interface)
* import in PROD can be done through the UI

== Deployment process

box SERP
actor bo as "Model Tuner"

actor a as "Approver"

actor s as "Policy Manager"

box Bank

box "Pre-Prod"

box "Prod"
    participant prodserp as "SERP"

bo -> serp : Create a Simulation
bo -> serp : Run Simulation
serp -> serp : Process Simulation
bo -> serp : Eyeballing on the Simulation results
bo -> serp : Send Simulation to the Approver

serp -> a : A new Simulation to approve

a -> serp : Eyeballing on the Simulation results
a -> serp : Approve Simulation
serp -> serp : SERP use a new policy\non a pre prod env

bo -> serp : Export policy
serp -> bo : **policy.json**


alt CLI import

bo -> s : **policy.json**
s -> s : Collect all required approvals on the new json. (mail?)

s -> m : Document with a step to import **policy.json** file on a prod
s -> m : **policy.json**

m -> prodserp : Import **policy.json** on the prod env using CLI

else WebUI import

s -> prodserp : Import **policy.json** on the prod env
prodserp -> a : A new Policy to approve
a -> prodserp : Approve a new policy

end alt

prodserp -> prodserp : SERP use a new policy\non a prod env
