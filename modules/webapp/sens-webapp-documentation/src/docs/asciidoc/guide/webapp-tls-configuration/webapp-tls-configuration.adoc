Silent Eight Name Screening Web Application (WebApp) comes with Caddy Web Server.
Caddy serves static Web content for the WebApp front-end (a JavaScript single page application).
Caddy also proxies requests to the WebApp back-end (a Java service, implementing REST APIs supporting front-end).
Caddy can serve content using either HTTP or HTTPS.
By default, Caddy uses a certificate automatically generated by SERP during installation.
