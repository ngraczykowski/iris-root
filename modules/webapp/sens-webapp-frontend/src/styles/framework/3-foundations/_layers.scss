// Define layers in the application is very important because it will help to define hierarchy and focus User attention on the highest element in front of other elements of the UI.
//
// Styles below are defined using two styles "box-shadow" to give a visual hierarchy and "z-index" which tells the browser what is the order in which the elements are displayed in the Z axis.

// Layer for all elements

%layer-on-surface {
  z-index: 100;
}

%layer-above-surface {
  z-index: 100;
}

// Layer for context elements like a tooltip, menu, etc.
%layer-context-element {
  z-index: 200;
}

// Layer for any kind of popup elements like modal window, dialog, alert, notification, etc.
%layer-popup-window {
  z-index: 300;
}

// This layer is reserved only for the critical situation when we want to lock access to UI without resetting the Users work. Example situation: when the connection between server and browser was lost.
%layer-critical-situation {
  z-index: 10000;
}
