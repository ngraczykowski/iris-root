// The 8-Point Grid is based on multiples of number 8 and it is an efficient way to create a consistent User Interface with proper harmony between elements.
//
// 8 point grid should be used to define dimensions, size, padding, and margin for all elements of the entire User Interface.
//
// Please use the function below to calculate all value that will define size or space of Interface element like text, button, etc.
