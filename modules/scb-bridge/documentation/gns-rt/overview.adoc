= Overview

GNS-RT (Global Name Screening -- Real-Time) is a system used in the first stage of customer screening, performed in near real-time prior to account opening.
It is used to compare customer and related party names against Deny and Due Diligence (PEP +  Adverse Media) lists to identify any sanctioned or high-risk customers that require further investigation or enhanced due diligence.


There are two parts of the integration:

* Realtime integration of GNS Realtime
* Near Real-time integration of GNS Realtime

In first cycle, GNS-RT will communicate with Silent Eight using the REST-based (Representational State Transfer) API protocolÂ over HTTP/1.1. Each GNS-RT request may contain up to five alerts to which Silent Eight will provide proper recommendations.
In second, SERP will fetch data from Trust Database and dedicated *S8 SERP RT View* which contains data from *CBS RT Hit Detail* table.
Both solution are described in link:architecture.adoc[Architecture].

All GNS-RT requests are sent in JSON format.
OpenAPI described link:open-api.adoc[here] defines a standard of the communication protocol.

Section link:gns-rt-to-s8-mappings.adoc[mapping] describes how particular fields from Input JSON (SGBML) corresponds with Silent Eight objects used in alert processing.

Sections link:request_examples.adoc[request] and link:response_examples.adoc[response] contains examples of GNS-RT requests and responses.
