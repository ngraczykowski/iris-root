= Acknowledgement

After SCB Bridge reads an alert with all the details and sends it for processing, CBS ACK function is called.
This function is called once for each alert.

For solving on watchlist level, only *new* hits in each alert are acknowledged.
For alert level solving, whole alert is acknowledged, even alert with no new hits.

Once an alert is acknowledged it is not returned by source view until new recommendation is required.

Damaged alerts are also acknowledged although they are not processed and will never receive the recommendation.
