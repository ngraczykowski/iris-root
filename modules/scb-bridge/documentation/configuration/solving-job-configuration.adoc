= Configuring the CBS Solving Job

Solving jobs (Queuing jobs) are fetching alerts from multiple views simultaneously.

Each job fetch alerts from CBS for processing on alert-level or watchlist-level using prioritized queue.

Along-side, the fetching job retrieves the alert identifiers from prioritized queue, reads full alert data and sends it for recommendation.
The fetching job ensures that the sequence of calls to ACK and RECOM is correct.
