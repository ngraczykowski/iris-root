= Conventions for ADR

== Tools

To create and manage ADR-s we use https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[adr-tools].

== Naming convention

- **SYS**: Decisions considering whole system including development|deployment|maintenance process
- **APP**: Decisions considering concrete application.For now we have one so prefix is APP, but in the future it may change
- **APP-<module_name>**: Decisions considering particular module.


== Content convention

Only obligatory sections are:

- Name (in first line) This is what is displayed in structurizr
- Status
- Context
- Decision

If there is need for additional you can add them freely :)
