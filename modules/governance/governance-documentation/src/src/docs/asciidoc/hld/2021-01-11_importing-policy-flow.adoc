= HLD #26

- Reference ticket: TBA
- Reason: We want to present the process of preparing, approving and deployment of steps configuration on a pre-prod and prod environment.

Policy state:

 - Draft -> Draft
 - Saved -> Ready (-> Ready for simulation)
 - Used -> Used for solving -> Used for solving on this environment
 - Archived -> Archived

INFO:
 - backend_value -> frontend_value (-> frontend_value_in the future) -> tooltip/explanation

For policies used in production, we should have a separate flag, because we can have a policy used in production and at the same time use it in this specific environment.
Prod: boolean -> Used on production -> Used for solving in production
