Customer Bridge will receive messages with any updates related to the production policy.
Customer Bridge *MUST* add a queue to gov.events exchange to receive this information.

Scenario 1:

. All components down
. Customer Bridge is up
. No message on a queue
. Customer Bridge works, but no alerts will be taken to QCO

Scenario 2:

. All components down
. Gov and Front is up
. User change QCO settings
. Customer Bridge is up
. Customer Bridge reads the configuration and applies it to alerts

Scenario 3.

. All components up
. User change QCO settings
. Customer Bridge reads the configuration and applies it to alerts
