== Simulator MVP

- Reference ticket: TBA
- Reason:
We want to introduce an MVP version of the simulator.
We will add functionality to the Reco service and in the future, after extraction of `Commentator` and `Strategy Solver` we will rename Reco to Simulator.

reco -> reco : generate UUID for alert in specific version
reco -> db : store alert reason with metadata \n(country / date / watchlist / etc)
reco -> bridge : solved alert

== Prepare dataset ==

reco -> queue : store dataset
...
queue -> reco : read dataset
reco -> db : query alerts
db -> reco : list of alerts UUID
reco -> db : save dataset \n(dataset name + list of alerts UUID)

gov -> reco : matches solutions
reco -> reco : alert solution based on strategy
reco -> reco : generate comment
reco -> reco : prepare reports for simulation
reco -> fs : store reports
fs -> reco : simulation reports url
reco -> db : save simulation report for simulation id

== Pros

. Fast development.
. MVP delivered on time.
. Evolution not revolution.
. More time to prepare a proper solution (for both simulation and solving).

== Cons

. We might end up in a dead-end.
. We may not have time to come up with the right solution.
. Solution good enough for MVP but not good enough as a target.
