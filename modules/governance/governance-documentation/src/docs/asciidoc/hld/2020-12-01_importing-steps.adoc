@startuml

box "REST"
    participant API
end box

box "Governance" #LightBlue
    participant backend as "Governance"
    database db as "Governance DB"
end box

API -> backend : Import steps - create new policy based on configuration.
backend -> backend : Create a new policy with steps.
note over API, db
For the sake of simplicity, before we will introduce the simulator,
we can assume that for solving we will use the newest policy stored in the database.
end note

backend -> db : Save the new policy.

====

API -> backend : Import steps - create new policy based on configuration,\nbut copy the exceptions (Steps created by CB)
backend -> db : Read exceptions from current policy.
backend -> backend : Create a new policy with new steps and current exceptions.
backend -> db : Save the new policy.

backend -> backend : Send event to reload the configuration
