== Assumptions

In warehouse application, our presupposition is to rely on configuration as much as it is possible,
therefore creating/adjusting/removing reports does not impact on code and does not need any changes there.

=== Creating reports

---

- Configuration file

---

Configuration is dependent on the client, so first, you need to select proper
*.yaml* file.

When the application is deployed on nomad then go to: $ cd *nomad/conf*

Alternatively, the configuration could be found in the *warehouse-app* module, for ex. AWS environment.

[#img-conf]
.Nomad conf directory
image::img_1.png[conf_folder,float="left",align="center"]

[#img-conf2]
.location of AWS env config file
image::img_2.png[conf_folder,align="center"]

___

- Structure of configuration

---

All reports are under the *warehouse.report.v2.reports* property

To create a new report, simply what's need to be done:

* [*] find correct *.yml* configuration file
* [x] go to proper configuration property
* [x] create new entry which consist of (_name, type, description, selectSqlQuery_) attributes

=== Example report

        SELECT wa.name                                             AS "S8 Alert ID",
          wsm.payload ->> 'clientMatchId'                          AS "Client Match ID",
          wsm.payload ->> 'match_reason:policy'                    AS "Policy ID",
          wsm.payload ->> 'match_reason:policy_title'              AS "Policy Name",
          wsm.payload ->> 'match_reason:step'                      AS "Step ID",

        FROM warehouse_simulation_alert wsa
        JOIN warehouse_alert wa ON wsa.name = wa.name
        JOIN warehouse_simulation_match wsm ON wsm.alert_name = wsa.name
        WHERE wsa.analysis_name = 'analysis/${analysisId}'
          AND wsm.analysis_name = 'analysis/${analysisId}'

    - name: next report name

----

1. The value that will be in the file name
2. As we support _production_ and _simulation_ reports, one of them should be there
3. The value that will appear in our FE application as "Report name"
---
[#img-conf]
image::img_5.png[conf_folder,float="left",align="center"]
---
4. Output of this query should be identical to values that appear in the report file.
There is the possibility to pass parameters into query see. *21/22* file of <<Example report>>.
The parameter should be stored in placeholder *${}* for supported placeholders go to <<Query placeholders>>

:icons: font
NOTE: query should not end with *;* this will cause an exception in our application

=== Display on UI

To have reports available on UI, there is no more work to be done besides that configuration entry
needs to be added/removed/modified

FE fetches available reports from our configuration file, this is done by API what is exposed:

  /api/v2/analysis/{type}/reports:
    get:
      summary: "GET api/v2/analysis/{type}/reports"
      operationId: "getAvailableReports"
      parameters:
      - name: "type"
        in: "path"
        required: true
        schema:
          type: "string"
      responses:
        "200":
          description: "OK"

where *{type}* is production / simulation.

:icons: font
NOTE: if something is missing on FE side, please check response using this endpoint

=== Database structure


[#img-tables]
.Main database report tables
image::img.png[conf_folder,float="center",align="center"]


1. _warehouse_alert_ and _warehouse_match_ - those table represents production data
2. _warehouse_simulation_ and _warehouse_simulation_match_ - represents simulation data flow

__1 Alert could have N __matches and joining tabels should look like:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT *
FROM warehouse_alert wa
    JOIN warehouse_match wm ON wa.id = wm.alert_id
----

[#img-query]
.Production alert with matches
image::img_3.png[conf_folder,float="center",align="center"]


___

Similar behaviour we could observe in simulation table

1 Simulation alert could have N matches - but be careful here

CAUTION: same alert and match could be used in few simulations, so there is need to filter them based on *analysisId*!
See line 4,5 in example below.

[source%linenums,sql]
----
SELECT *
FROM warehouse_simulation_alert wsa
  JOIN warehouse_simulation_match wsm ON wsa.name = wsm.alert_name
WHERE wsa.analysis_name = 'analysis/${analysisId}'
  AND wsm.analysis_name = 'analysis/${analysisId}'
----

In simulation reports, there is the possibility to join production alerts and matches. If a report needs to contain additional data from those tables be careful and pay attention to how tables should be connected to avoid data inconsistency

* simulation alert -> production alert
* simulation match -> production match

[source%linenums,sql]
----
SELECT *
    FROM warehouse_simulation_alert wsa
       JOIN warehouse_simulation_match wsm ON wsa.name = wsm.alert_name
       LEFT JOIN warehouse_alert wa ON wsa.name = wa.name
       LEFT JOIN warehouse_match wm ON wsm.name = wm.name
WHERE wsa.analysis_name = 'analysis/${analysisId}'
  AND wsm.analysis_name = 'analysis/${analysisId}'
----


The most interesting data, is stored in *payload::jsonb* column, this column occurs in all mentioned previously tables :

* warehouse_alert
* warehouse_match
* warehouse_simulation
* warehouse_simulation_match

Postgresql offers various ways to deal with jsonb type.

Here is as example of extracting a few attributes from payload into a response
[source,sql]
----
SELECT wa.payload ->> 'policy_title' as policy,
       wm.payload ->> 'step_title' as step
FROM warehouse_alert wa
     JOIN warehouse_match wm ON wa.id = wm.alert_id

=== Query placeholders

Placeholders are used to pass additional parameters into report query, see 21/22 of <<Example report>>

Supported placeholder by warehouse application:

    * from
    * to
    * analysisId
    * countries

*from* and *to* act as date-time filters in production reports

[source,sql]
----
SELECT wa.payload ->> 'policy_title' as policy,
       wm.payload ->> 'step_title' as step
FROM warehouse_alert wa
     JOIN warehouse_match wm ON wa.id = wm.alert_id
WHERE wa.recommendation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '${from}' AND TIMESTAMP '${to}'
----

*countries* placeholder could act as a region filter for ex.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT wa.payload ->> 'policy_title' as policy,
       wm.payload ->> 'step_title' as step
FROM warehouse_alert wa
     JOIN warehouse_match wm ON wa.id = wm.alert_id
WHERE wa.recommendation_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '${from}' AND TIMESTAMP '${to}'
AND (payload ->> 's8_lobCountryCode') IN (${countries})
----

*analysisId* is used in simulation reports, to query only records which participated in a concrete simulation

[source,sql]
----
SELECT wa.discriminator                                        AS "S8 Alert ID",
       wa.payload ->> 'clientId'                               AS "Client Alert ID",
       wsm.payload ->> 'match_reason:step_title'               AS "Step Name",
       wsm.payload ->> 'match_reason:feature_vector_signature' AS "Reasoning Branch ID",
       wsa.payload ->> 'recommendation_recommended_action'     AS "S8 Hit Resolution",
       wsa.payload ->> 'recommendation_create_time'            AS "S8 Resolution Timestamp",
       wsa.payload ->> 'recommendation_comment'                AS "S8 Hit Reason"
FROM warehouse_simulation_alert wsa
  JOIN warehouse_alert wa ON wsa.name = wa.name
  JOIN warehouse_simulation_match wsm ON wsm.alert_name = wsa.name
WHERE wsa.analysis_name = 'analysis/${analysisId}'
  AND wsm.analysis_name = 'analysis/${analysisId}'
----


=== Detecting issues

.Production reports

* Verify that the list of reports in UI "Reports" tab is in line with the client speification
*  Make sure that it is possible to successfully generate all the reports for a time range that guarantees sufficient amount of data (recommended minimum is 5k alerts)
**  For each report:
*** Verify visually that there are no outstanding issues (e.g. no empty columns, no empty rows)
*** Data in the report has expected format and values
(e.g. dates have proper format, "S8 Recommendations" have valid values, "S8 Reason" contains human readable text)
*** AI reasoning (alert level) has number of rows that matches the number of alerts processed within selected time range.
*** AI reasoning (match level) has number of rows that matches the total number of matches processed within selected time range.
*** Accuracy (alert level) has number of rows that matches the number of alerts processed within selected time range and supplied with learning data
*** RB scorer's match count column total is equal to the total number of matches processed within selected time range.

.Simulation reports

* Verify that the list of reports in the simulation details is in line with the client speification
* Make sure that it is possible to successfully generate all the reports for a sample simulation (recommended minimum size is 5k alerts)
* For each report:
** Verify visually that there are no outstanding issues (e.g. no empty columns, no empty rows)
** Data in the report has expected format and values (e.g. dates have proper format, "S8 Recommendations" have valid values, "S8 Reason" contain human readable text)
** AI reasoning (alert level) has number of rows that matches the number of alerts processed as a part of the reference simulation.
** AI reasoning (match level) has number of rows that matches the total number of matches processed as a part of the reference simulation.
** Accuracy (alert level) has number of rows that matches the number of alerts processed as a part of the reference simulation and supplied with learning data
** RB scorer's match count column total is equal to the total number of matches processed as a part of the reference simulation.
* Verify that there are not outstanding issues in the "Overview" section (Total alerts count matches with the dataset size, the statistcs corresponds to expected values)
