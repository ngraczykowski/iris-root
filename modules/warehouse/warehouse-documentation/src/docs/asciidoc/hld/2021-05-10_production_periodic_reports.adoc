- Created at: *10.05.2021*
- Reference ticket: *https://silent8.atlassian.net/browse/WEB-774[WEB-774]*
- Reason: Production periodic reports processing


== Assumptions

In the diagram, we assume that:

- Elastic already contains all the data required to generate reports,
- Kibana already has defined reports in a master tenant.

== Generating and storing periodic reports (Reports stored in Minio with all countries' data)

Generating those reports is controlled by Kibana.
The user defines a cron job, when a report should be generated,
and this report is generated automatically by Kibana.

== Downloading periodic reports (Reports stored in Minio with all countries' data)

This part is already designed but does not have a clear use case to download those reports from Minio.

Those reports are needed just for the audit.
Reports contain personal data related to all countries, and we do not have a user with permission to access data from all countries.
