header Feed WH with data created during the simulation

ae ->> r : Some recommendation generated message
note over ae, r
this message will be sent several times before analysis will be finished
end note
r ->> sim : Fetch message RecommendationsGenerated
sim -> db : Set simulation state to **RUNNING**
sim ->> ae : Fetch **GetAnalysis**
sim -> sim : Check AnalysisState
alt AnalysisStatus == **DONE**
sim -> ae : Fetch **streamRecommendationsWithMetadata**
ae --> sim : Dispatch Iterator<RecommendationWithMetaData>
sim -> sim : Build SimulationDataIndexRequest objects with batched alerts
sim -> db : Add a row with information: \nanalysis_name, SENT, alerts count for batch
sim ->> r : Send message on a sim.event exchange with batch
wh ->> r : ACK message on wh.event exchange for batch
r ->> sim : Fetch ACK message from sim.index-response.simulation for batch
sim -> db : Add a row with information: \nanalysis_name, RECEIVED, alerts count for batch
sim -> db : Get sum of alerts **SENT** and **RECEIVED**
alt **SENT** == **RECEIVED**
sim -> db : Set simulation state to **DONE**
end alt
end alt

=== Cleaning db
We will clear all rows with SENT/RECEIVED information for specific analysis when the simulation will be archived.
