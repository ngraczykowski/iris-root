header Feed WH with data created during the simulation

database SimulatorDB as db

participant Warehouse as wh

autonumber

ae -> r : Some recommendation generated message
note over ae, r
this message will be sent several times before analysis will be finished
end note
r -> sim : Fetch message
sim -> db : Set simulation state to **RUNNING**
sim -> ae : Fetch recommendations based on \na list of recommendations from the message
ae -> sim : Recommendations with a related alert name
sim -> ae : Fetch alerts based on \na list of alerts provided in the recommendation
ae -> sim : Alerts
sim -> sim : Build SimulationDataIndexRequest message
sim -> r : Send message on a sim.event exchange
sim -> db : Add a row with information: \nanalysis_name, SENT, alerts count
r -> wh : Fetch message from wh.index-request.simulation
wh -> r : ACK message on wh.event exchange
r -> sim : Fetch ACK message from sim.index-response.simulation
sim -> db : Add a row with information: \nanalysis_name, RECEIVED, alerts count
sim -> ae : Get analysis status
ae -> sim : Analysis status
alt Status == **DONE**
sim -> db : Get sum of alerts **SENT** and **RECEIVED**
alt **SENT** == **RECEIVED**
sim -> db : Set simulation state to **DONE**
end alt
end alt

=== Cleaning db
We will clear all rows with SENT/RECEIVED information for specific analysis when the simulation will be archived.
